**Getting Started with ai-doc-gen**
=====================================

Welcome to ai-doc-gen, a project that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to generate project documentation. This guide will walk you through setting up and using ai-doc-gen.

**Prerequisites and System Requirements**
----------------------------------------

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

*   A compatible operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
*   A working Python environment (version 3.8 or higher recommended)
*   The `ollama` and `llama` libraries installed (`pip install ollama llama`)
*   Basic knowledge of Markdown formatting

**Installation Instructions**
---------------------------

1.  Clone the repository using Git:
    ```bash
git clone https://github.com/charudatta10/ai-doc-gen.git
```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
cd ai-doc-gen
```

**Basic Configuration**
----------------------

To start generating documentation, follow these steps:

1.  Initialize a new configuration file using the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file as an example:
    ```yml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml

repos:
- repo: https://github.com/charudatta10/pre-commit-config
  rev: main
  hooks:
  - id: black
    name: Black Code Formatter
    entry: black --line-length 88 .
  - id: flake8
    name: Flake8 Linting
    entry: flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,E10,E11,E12,E15,E16,E18,E27,E78,E80,R,C,F,C,H,R,O,D --show-covers .
```
2.  Run the project using `invoke`:
    ```
invoke
```

**Running a Simple Example**
---------------------------

To see ai-doc-gen in action, follow these steps:

1.  Create a new file named `example.md` and add some basic Markdown content:
    ```md
# Hello World

This is an example of ai-doc-gen in action.
```
2.  Run the following command to generate documentation for the `example.md` file:
    ```
invoke --config example.md
```
