---------------

To get started with ai-doc-gen, you will need:

### 1. Python Environment

*   Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
*   Install pip, the package installer for Python, if it's not already installed.

### 2. Docker Installation

ai-doc-gen uses Docker to run and deploy applications. You can download the Docker Desktop client from the official Docker website: <https://www.docker.com/get-started>

### 3. .NET Core SDK

The .NET Core SDK is required for running ai-doc-gen. Install it using the following command:

To get started with ai-doc-gen, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository using Git:

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash

## Basic Configuration
--------------------

Before running the application, you need to configure it properly.

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following configuration variables:

services:
    app:
        build: .
        ports:
