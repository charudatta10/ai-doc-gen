**Pull Request Process**
----------------------

To contribute to ai-doc-gen, please follow these steps:

1. ** Fork the repository**: Clone the repository and create a new branch from `main`.
2. **Make changes**: Make your desired changes to the codebase.
3. **Write tests**: Write tests for your changes using our testing framework (more on this below).
4. **Commit changes**: Commit all changes, including tests, with a descriptive commit message.
5. **Create a pull request**: Create a new pull request against the `main` branch.

**Coding Standards**
------------------

We follow the following coding standards:

* **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs).
* **Line length**: Limit lines to 80 characters.
* **Naming conventions**: Follow PEP 8 naming conventions (e.g., `snake_case`).

**Testing Requirements**
----------------------

To ensure our codebase is stable, we require the following:

* **Unit tests**: Write unit tests for all new code changes using our testing framework.
* **Integration tests**: Write integration tests to verify interactions between different components.

For more information on our testing framework, please refer to [tasks.py](https://github.com/charudatta10/ai-doc-gen/blob/main/tasks.py).

**Documentation Guidelines**
---------------------------

To maintain accurate and up-to-date documentation, follow these guidelines:

* **Use Markdown**: Document everything using Markdown (e.g., `# heading`, `## subheading`).
* **Keep it concise**: Keep your documentation brief and to the point.
* **Use examples**: Include code examples where applicable.
