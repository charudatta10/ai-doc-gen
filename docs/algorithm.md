# Algorithm Documentation for AI-DOC-GEN

## Key Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Algorithms

*   **Llama**: Llama is a large language model developed by Meta, designed to process natural language inputs and generate human-like responses. The `ollama` package used in this project leverages the power of Llama for text generation and documentation.
*   **LLaMA**: LLaMA (Large Language Model Application) is another variant of Llama that is optimized for sequence-to-sequence tasks, making it suitable for document generation.

### 2. Machine Learning Algorithms

*   **Supervised Learning**: The project employs supervised learning techniques to train the NLP models on a dataset of existing documentation.
*   **Unsupervised Learning**: For generating novel content, unsupervised learning algorithms are used to discover patterns and relationships in the training data.

## Mathematical Foundations

The mathematical foundation of this project is built upon:

### 1. Probability Theory

Probability theory forms the basis of NLP models' ability to make predictions about language structures and patterns. The use of Llama and LLaMA algorithms relies heavily on advances in probability theory, including Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for optimizing language model parameters.

### 2. Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is essential for understanding the operations performed by NLP models, such as matrix multiplications used in neural network computations.

## Performance Characteristics

The performance characteristics of this project are:

### 1. Training Speed

*   The use of Llama and LLaMA allows for efficient training times, with most tasks completed within a few minutes.
*   This is largely due to the optimized architecture and parallelization techniques implemented in the `ollama` package.

### 2. Generation Speed

*   The model's generation speed can be quite high, allowing it to produce documentation at a rapid pace.
*   However, this speed comes at the cost of some compromise on quality.

### 3. Resource Requirements

*   Training and deployment of this project require significant computational resources.
*   These include large amounts of memory (GPU or TPUs) for training and relatively smaller amounts for inference.

## Optimization Techniques

Several optimization techniques are employed in this project:

### 1. Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning is crucial for optimizing the performance of Llama and LLaMA models. The `ollama` package includes an extensive set of hyperparameters that can be adjusted to suit different use cases.

### 2. Model Compression

Model compression techniques are used to reduce the model size without sacrificing performance. This technique involves reducing the number of parameters or eliminating redundant computations in the model.

```bash
invoke
```

This will start the generation process using Llama or LLaMA.

#### 2. Optimizing Hyperparameters

To optimize hyperparameters for your specific use case, use the `--tuning` flag followed by a path to your hyperparameter configuration file:

```bash
invoke --tuning /path/to/config.yaml
```

This will perform hyperparameter tuning using the specified configuration file.

#### 3. Model Compression

For model compression, you can use the following command:

```bash
invoke --compress
```

This will start the model compression process.
